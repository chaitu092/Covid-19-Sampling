# Covid-19-Sampling

## Objective
1. Predict confirmed COVID-19 cases among suspected cases.
Based on the results of laboratory tests commonly collected for a suspected COVID-19 case during a visit to the emergency room, would it be possible to predict the test result for SARS-Cov-2 (positive/negative)?

2. Based on the results of laboratory tests commonly collected among confirmed COVID-19 cases during a visit to the emergency room, would it be possible to predict which patients will need to be admitted to a general ward, semi-intensive unit or intensive care unit?

## Dataset
This dataset contains anonymized data from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and additional laboratory tests during a visit to the hospital.

All data were anonymized following the best international practices and recommendations. All clinical data were standardized to have a mean of zero and a unit standard deviation.
